**Objective:**

The goal of this project is to leverage data-driven insights to enhance the efficiency of healthcare services and improve the overall patient experience. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset encompassing patient demographics, satisfaction scores, wait times, and referral patterns, we aim to provide valuable insights for optimizing various aspects of healthcare operations.

**Column Datatypes:**

``Date``: The date and time when the patient record was created or updated.

``Patient_ID``: A unique identifier assigned to each patient, presumably for tracking and referencing.

``Patient_Gender``: The gender of the patient (M for male, F for female).

``Patient_Age``: The age of the patient at the time of the record.

``Patient_SAT_Score``: A numerical score representing the patient's satisfaction level. It ranges from 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest satisfaction level.

``Patient_First_Initial``: The first initial of the patient's first name.

``Patient_Last_Name``: The last name of the patient.

``Patient_Race``: The racial or ethnic background of the patient (e.g., White, Native American/Alaska Native, African American, Asian, Two or More Races).

``Patient_Admin_Flag``: True indicated the patient is a Admin and is regestered staff or any one under the Hospital program (Insurance).

``Patient_Waittime``: The amount of time the patient had to wait, possibly in minutes, before receiving medical attention or service.

``Department_Referral``: The medical department or service to which the patient is referred.

**Insights Provided for**:

**Average Wait Time:**

Discover how long patients typically wait before their appointments. Uncover patterns and trends that shed light on the efficiency of our healthcare system.

**Patient Satisfaction:**

We'll explore the average satisfaction scores given by our patients. Learn about the factors that contribute to a positive patient experience and how we can enhance it.

**Total Patient Visits Monthly:**

Get an overview and flow of patients through our doors each month. Understand the dynamics of healthcare demand over time.

**Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments:**

Delve into the data to distinguish between appointments that involve administrative processes and those that don't. Explore the impact on wait times and patient satisfaction.

**Referrals and Walk-In Patients:**

Uncover the balance between patients referred to specific departments and those who walk in without prior referral. How does this impact the overall patient experience?

**Patient Visits by Age Group and Race:**

Explore the distribution of patient visits across different age groups and races. Gain insights into the diversity of healthcare needs and preferences.
